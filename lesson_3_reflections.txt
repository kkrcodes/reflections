When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    For collaborating with other developers, working on open-source and company projects, sharing the projects for others to use and modify, and showcasing personal projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There maybe new but different changes (new feature, bug-fix, experimentation) in the remote repository that one doesn't want to merge with the local repository yet and vice-versa, or collaborators may be working on a new version of the project that's different from the updated remote repository and don't want the new changes from it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are for working on other people's repos you don't have permission to directly modify, clones are for working locally on remote repos, and branches are for development or bug-fixes in repos.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
