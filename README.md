course.

## About
This repository is an exercise from Udacity's **_How to Use Git and GitHub_** course. To leverage reinforcement learning and practice using version control, we were encouraged to reflect on the concepts learned in each lesson of the course and commit the changes to a repository. This repository contains my reflections of the concepts taught in the course.
