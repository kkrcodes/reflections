# Reflections
Reflections from the lessons taught in Udacity's [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) 
course.

## About
I took the **_How to Use Git and GitHub_** course from Udacity, and as a practical approach to use version control, we were encouraged to 
reflect on the concepts learned in each lesson of the course and commit the changes in a repository. This repository contains my
reflections from the concepts I learned in the course.
